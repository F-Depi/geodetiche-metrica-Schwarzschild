\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank my family and friends for their support and encouragement
during my studies and throughout the production of this thesis.
A special thanks to my dear friend Arrigo, whose persistent encouragement
motivated me to improve my English skills.

I also wish to thank my supervisor, Dr. Albino Perego, for his guidance
throughout this work.
His ability to find a topic that perfectly aligned with both my interests and
capabilities made this thesis possible.

\begin{abstract}
    The \Sh metric provides a straightforward and effective framework for a
    first approach at the theory of general relativity.
    This thesis examines the metric through the motion of test particles and
    photons.
    Analytical solutions are presented for phenomena such as gravitational
    redshift and radial infalls. The precession of orbits and the deflection of
    light are explored by deriving the corresponding equations. \\
    Equations of motion for test particles are solved in case of strong
    gravitational field with a fourth order Runge-Kutta method.
    Numerical solutions are confronted with analytical ones when possible and
    stability tests are performed by repeating the same simulations with
    different time step increments.
